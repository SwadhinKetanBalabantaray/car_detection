# car_detection
Haar Cascades: A traditional computer vision approach using Haar features and a cascade classifier.  It's relatively fast but might not be as accurate as deep learning methods.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): A family of fast and accurate object detection models.  YOLO models are known for their speed and efficiency.

SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): Another popular object detection model that balances speed and accuracy.

Other Deep Learning Models:  Other models like Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, or custom-trained models can also be used.

The specific implementation will vary depending on the chosen method.  The repository might contain separate scripts for each method (e.g., car_detector_haar.py, car_detector_yolo.py).
